# Remember to split your project per phases

- After each phase, document the project roadmap updates in Claude file to make sure include all the phase context, learnings, etc.
- Restart your claude for the next project.
- Reason is context built too much over time that Claude Code and you won't be able to keep track on the changes.
- So better to document the latest correct understanding per phase, close Claude Code to refresh the latest context.
- Also a good way to remove all unnecessary files, refine your project structure and codebase for better maintenance long term.
