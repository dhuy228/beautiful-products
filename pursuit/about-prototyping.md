# Two biggest pitfalls of prototyping

## 1. You don't test your prototype.

Test your prototype against all 4 product risks (usability, value, viability, feasibility) and all the hypothesis you have. Ideally, your aim is to get surprises.

Here is a portfolio of tactics for gathering rapid user feedback, presented from the faster (and potentially less accurate) to the slower (and potentially more accurate):

• **Look at the product yourself and go by your gut.** (10 minutes)
This is considered the fastest tactic for getting feedback. If you are a subject matter expert, this approach can be surprisingly effective.

• **Ask three friends or teammates to play with your product and get feedback.** (4 hours)
This is a slightly slower method than relying solely on your own gut.

• **Ask three to ten strangers for feedback.** (8 hours)
This tactic is a bit slower than asking friends or teammates. A common strategy is to learn to spot places with high foot traffic, such as coffee shops or hotel lobbies, and respectfully ask strangers for their feedback on what you are building. Many people working in these locations are happy for an excuse to be distracted and provide feedback.

• **Send prototypes to 100 testers.** (~ 1 week)
If you have access to larger groups of users, you can send prototypes to even more users. This tactic falls into the category of "slower and slower tactics".

• **Send prototypes to 1000 users.** (~ 2 weeks)
If you have access to larger groups of users, you can send prototypes to even more users to get qualitative and quantitative feedback. This tactic falls into the category of "slower and slower tactics".

• **A/B testing.** (~ 2 months)
Contrary to what many might think, A/B testing is considered one of the slowest tactics in this portfolio, primarily because it is slow to ship.

It's important to note that when using any tactic beyond the first one (your own gut instinct), teams often don't just use the results to make a direct choice (e.g., product A or product B). 
Instead, they carefully analyze the data to hone their instincts and improve the rate at which they can use the first tactic (their gut) to make high-quality decisions. This involves reflecting on the data to update their mental models of users, thereby improving the quality of their intuition for faster product decisions.

## 2. You use it as a communication tool to move product discovery quickly to product delivery

Before product discovery, it's important to have the criteria that defines the success of your product - the DoD.

This is to help teams avoid getting too excited and moving to product delivery too quickly without confirming this is the right solution worth building.

Know when to show to stakeholders and know when to stop prototyping is one of the most important integrity from PM throughout this process - constantly evaluating whether there is enough evidence to validate all the neccessary hypothesis, pushing back the urge to build is a neccesary courage to have.

"The danger is that many people mistakenly confuse this with the primary purpose of the prototype.  They want to create an effective artifact for communication, and they use a prototyping tool to do this.  But without testing the prototype, they end up spending the time and money to build a product that ends up failing in the market."
