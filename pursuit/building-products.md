I'm gonna steal Julie's explanation as followed:
## The price of greatness
If you surround yourself with great people, you’re going to get better faster. But the price you pay is the constant feeling of inadequacy.

If you invest in equities over a long enough period, you’re going to make money. But the price you pay is the constant feeling that you’ve missed out on some important trend or deal.

If you study a topic deeply enough to becoming discerning within it, you’re going to be called an ‘expert’ or ‘visionary’. But the price you pay is constant disappointment that the world and your work doesn’t measure up to your vision.

Every glamour has its price.

Most people think the price of winning — of greatness — is hard work and sacrifice. But beyond that, it’s also the mental battle. The constant drumbeat of dissatisfaction. There is no end to it. Consistent high achievers learn to make peace with it.

Of course, this isn’t the only path.

Sometimes, social media makes it seem like achieving / winning / changing the world is the only game worth playing. It’s not.

Play the game that suits you. But know there is always a price.
