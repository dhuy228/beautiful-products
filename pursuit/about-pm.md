### For leaders:

Hire curious generalists, not specialists.
Track speed of feature development: ensure that it’s going up.
Reward doers over sayers: look for the proof in the problem solved, not in the discussion had

### For ICs:

Identify as a problem-solver: not an engineer / designer / pm.
Make AI your constant collaborator: experiment, experiment, experiment with doing things you would have previously relied on a teammate for. Experiment with doing whatever you know how to do well even faster.
Just do it: try stuff out, don’t wait around for permission.

### For Everyone:

Embrace the chaos. The future isn’t built on plans — it’s grown in gardens.

## AI favors the individual contributor

Imagine you’re assembling a team for an escape room challenge. Would you rather have six managers debating strategies or two sharp thinkers who rapidly test every combination to unlock the door?

Welcome to the era of AI-native companies, where individual contributors (ICs) reign supreme.

Prototype-and-prune calls for teams with the following 5 characteristics:

Tiny teams working in parallel — teams with a handful of people (think 1–3) can simultaneously explore a wider range of ideas to see if they work.

Blurred functional roles: why do you need a stool with three (or more) legs when a classically-trained engineer can use AI tools to iterate on mocks, a classically-trained designer can use AI tools to iterate on marketing copy, or a classically trained product manager can use AI tools to get insights from their data?
Reduction of “management” roles: the cost of communication overhead shrinks drastically when you go from 7–10 people to 3. 

The PM-as-coordinator, or manager-as-coordinator role is no longer needed until (maybe) the polish-and-productionize step.

Good taste: taste is the ability to distinguish excellence from mediocrity. The hand can never consistently produce better than the eye can discern.

High agency: AI favors those who bias towards action and see themselves as problem solvers with the power to get shit done. Those who prefer structure, consensus, and waiting to be told what to do will find themselves struggling.
