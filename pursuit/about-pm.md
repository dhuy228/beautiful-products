# About being a PM definition

## This is alignd with my understanding too - RAF > RFA
### For leaders:

Hire curious generalists, not specialists.
Track speed of feature development: ensure that it’s going up.
Reward doers over sayers: look for the proof in the problem solved, not in the discussion had

### For ICs:

Identify as a problem-solver: not an engineer / designer / pm.
Make AI your constant collaborator: experiment, experiment, experiment with doing things you would have previously relied on a teammate for. Experiment with doing whatever you know how to do well even faster.
Just do it: try stuff out, don’t wait around for permission.

### For Everyone:

Embrace the chaos. The future isn’t built on plans — it’s grown in gardens.

## AI favors the individual contributor

Imagine you’re assembling a team for an escape room challenge. Would you rather have six managers debating strategies or two sharp thinkers who rapidly test every combination to unlock the door?

Welcome to the era of AI-native companies, where individual contributors (ICs) reign supreme.

Prototype-and-prune calls for teams with the following 5 characteristics:

Tiny teams working in parallel — teams with a handful of people (think 1–3) can simultaneously explore a wider range of ideas to see if they work.

Blurred functional roles: why do you need a stool with three (or more) legs when a classically-trained engineer can use AI tools to iterate on mocks, a classically-trained designer can use AI tools to iterate on marketing copy, or a classically trained product manager can use AI tools to get insights from their data?
Reduction of “management” roles: the cost of communication overhead shrinks drastically when you go from 7–10 people to 3. 

The PM-as-coordinator, or manager-as-coordinator role is no longer needed until (maybe) the polish-and-productionize step.

Good taste: taste is the ability to distinguish excellence from mediocrity. The hand can never consistently produce better than the eye can discern.

High agency: AI favors those who bias towards action and see themselves as problem solvers with the power to get shit done. Those who prefer structure, consensus, and waiting to be told what to do will find themselves struggling.

## The price of greatness
If you surround yourself with great people, you’re going to get better faster. But the price you pay is the constant feeling of inadequacy.

If you invest in equities over a long enough period, you’re going to make money. But the price you pay is the constant feeling that you’ve missed out on some important trend or deal.

If you study a topic deeply enough to becoming discerning within it, you’re going to be called an ‘expert’ or ‘visionary’. But the price you pay is constant disappointment that the world and your work doesn’t measure up to your vision.

Every glamour has its price.

Most people think the price of winning — of greatness — is hard work and sacrifice. But beyond that, it’s also the mental battle. The constant drumbeat of dissatisfaction. There is no end to it. Consistent high achievers learn to make peace with it.

Of course, this isn’t the only path.

Sometimes, social media makes it seem like achieving / winning / changing the world is the only game worth playing. It’s not.

Play the game that suits you. But know there is always a price.
